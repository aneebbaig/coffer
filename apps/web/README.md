## Money Flow

Align enforces a strict zero-based budgeting model - money cannot enter or leave any bucket without a declared source.

### Income
- Income enters the system only through the **Income page**.
- Every income transaction increases the **Ready to Assign** pool for that month.

### Expenses
- Every expense must be funded from a real source: **monthly income** or a **savings pot**.
- Pot-funded expenses atomically deduct from the pot and create a pot ledger entry.
- Editing or deleting a pot-funded expense reverses the old pot movement before applying the new change.

### Savings Pots
- Three pot types: **Emergency Fund**, **Liquid Savings**, **General/Goal pots**.
- Depositing into any pot requires declaring a source: **monthly income** or **transfer from another pot**.
- Deposits from income are validated: available income = this month's income − income-funded expenses − existing income-funded pot deposits. Cannot deposit more than available.
- Transfers between pots are atomic (deduct + credit in one transaction, both sides logged).
- To spend from a pot, create an expense and select the pot as the funding source - there is no standalone "withdraw" action.
- Pots hold both PKR and USD; PKR and USD balances are tracked independently.
- **Income deletion is blocked** if that month's income-funded expenses + income-funded pot deposits exceed the remaining income after deletion. PKR and USD are checked separately. Remove the allocations first, then delete the income.
- USD/PKR exchange rate is **auto-synced daily** from `open.er-api.com` (free, no API key, ~30 calls/month). Can also be updated manually.

### Budget
- Budget page shows **Ready to Assign** = this month's income − budget category allocations − planned savings allocations.
- The expense form's **Available income** = this month's income − income-funded expenses − income-funded pot deposits (actual movements, not planned).
- Category budgets track allocated vs spent; over-budget categories turn red.
- Expenses against unbudgeted categories are flagged as "Unplanned".

## Design System

All UI follows a single card pattern - no one-off gradients or colored backgrounds on data cards.

### Card pattern
```
bg-card border border-border rounded-xl p-5
```
Icon lives in `p-2 rounded-lg bg-muted` with a semantic color class (`text-primary`, `text-emerald-600`, etc.). Value is `text-2xl font-bold text-foreground`. Label is `text-sm font-medium text-muted-foreground`.

### Color semantics
| Color | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `emerald` | Income, positive balance, safe status |
| `red` | Expenses, negative balance, critical status |
| `amber` | Warnings, low status, unplanned spending |
| `blue` | Info, neutral, liquid savings |
| `primary` (violet/indigo) | Brand actions, buttons, icons on neutral cards |

### Status cards only
Colored `bg-*-50 dark:bg-*-950` backgrounds are reserved for **status banners** (Ready to Assign, Emergency Fund health, budget exceeded) - not for primary data display cards.

### Sub-tiles inside cards
Use `bg-muted/50 rounded-lg` - never hardcoded colors or gradients.

## Roles

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| **Super Admin** | Full access including Vault and user management |
| **Admin** | Everything except Vault and user management |

## Local Development

You need a free [Neon](https://neon.tech) account. Neon gives you a cloud PostgreSQL database with separate **branches** (like git) - use the `dev` branch locally and `main` for production. No local database installation needed.

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
npm install

# 2. Copy env template and fill in your Neon dev branch URL
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local - paste DATABASE_URL from Neon → Connect → Prisma tab (dev branch)
# Use the DIRECT (non-pooler) URL for migrations - remove "-pooler" from the hostname

# 3. Create tables + seed users
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm run seed

# 4. Run
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

> **Neon pooler vs direct URL**: `prisma migrate dev` requires a direct connection (non-pooler hostname - no `-pooler` in the URL). The pooler URL is fine for the running app (`DATABASE_URL` at runtime). For production migrations, use `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` with `npx prisma migrate deploy`.

## Deployment

See **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Vercel + Neon, completely free, ~10 minutes.
